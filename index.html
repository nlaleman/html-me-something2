        <h2>What is Dungeons &amp; Dragons?</h2>
        <p>Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) is a tabletop fantasy role-playing game. It is one of the oldest games of its type, dating from the 1970s, and by far the most famous, with multiple appearances in popular media, and their own TV shows, movies, and video games. It is also the market leader. It occupies a place in the public consciousness that is enviable, and most lay-people who know what D&amp;D is would be surprised to learn that there are other types of games, and would be hard-pressed to name one.</p>
        <p>A tabletop role-playing game is a sort of shared experience between a group of players and a Game Master (GM). In D&amp;D, the GM is called a Dungeon Master (DM). There are game rules that form a framework within which the game occurs, and the players and DM use their imaginations to determine what happens. In general, the DM presents a scenario, and the players respond to it. It has been likened to a game of "let's pretend" with rules. D&amp;D takes place in a fantasy setting, with magic, warriors, dragons, and dungeons (hence the name), and is heavily influenced by fantasy fiction such as J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.</p>

        <h2>What is Adventurers League?</h2>
        <p>Adventurers League (AL) is the current official Organized Play organization for D&amp;D. Organized play exists for a few reasons, and it has existed in some form for quite some time. Organized play contains a set of rules, on top of the existing rules for D&amp;D, that helps ensure a "level playing field" between different groups playing the game. Most home groups of D&amp;D have their own "home-brew" rules that make their game unique and their own, and some groups may prefer a more high-fantasy world, while others prefer a grittier world. However, Organized Play occurs in a common shared world. This ensures that characters are <b>portable</b>.</p>
        <p>Why is portability and a shared world imortant? One reason is consistency. Ideally, an AL game in New York, NY should be the same as an AL game in Madison, WI, which should be the same as a game in the Phillipines or Russia or France. A player who is travelling should be able to drop in on a game and not be over- or under-powered. Another reason is convention play. Gaming conventions are events where many players come together, usually over the course of a weekend, and play games together. Organized play ensures that they are all playing the "same" game. This has grown even more with online games. Someone on a farm in Iowa can play with people from around the world, even if there isn't anyone in their local area that wants to play. And finally, playing in the official organized play campaign allows players the chance to affect the canon of the publisher's story going forward. Adventurers League is the official organized play for D&amp;D, sponsored by the parent company, Wizards of the Coast (WotC), but other organied play options exist, from old settings (Greyhawk) to third-party publishers (Kobold Press's Midgard Campaign) and even a campaign inspired by the media (Critical Role's Living Tal'dorei).</p>

        <h2>Adventurers League So Far</h2>
        <p>Adventures League is currently in its tenth "season." Each season roughly corresponds to a hardback adventure published by WotC. Play is broken down by tiers, with Tier 1 being for characters of level 1 through 4, Tier 2 for levels 5 through 10, Tier 3 for levels 11 through 16, and Tier 4 for levels 17 through 20. The AL rules have evolved over time, with the majority of those changes occuring in seasons 8 and later.</p>
        <p>Prior seasons awarded total experience points and gold, in amounts based on the level of the adventure, that was then divided between the characters. There was usually a single magic item, which could be claimed by one character. If multiple characters wanted a particular item, the character with the fewest items got to claim it. In the event of a tie, they rolled off for it. This system was how the game had been played in the past, but there were issues of characters advancing too quickly or too slowly, and of characters missing out on particularly nice magic items.</p>
        <p>Season 8 introduced advancement checkpoints and treasure checkpoints based on hours of play, as well as standard gold awards based on level, not awarded during the adventure. Magic items could be bought with treasure checkpoints based on an "evergreen" list and items that had been encountered in the adventure. Existing characters could keep their gold and items, other than a number of outlawed very powerful items, and there was a tendency for such "legacy" characters to be more powerful that new characters. These characters also had to be "converted" into the new system of advancement checkpoints. A number of players were unhappy with the new system, arguing that it reduced the imersion of the game, and eliminated their character's motivation, since gold was awarded when a character gained a level and could not be earned organically. The amount of gold was also much lower than in adventures from previous seasons. The magic item system allowed players to "buy" what items they wanted, reducing the number who felt left out by not being able to claim a particular item. Players also complained that the new system was more complicated, and was not the "game they knew." Some players left the Adventurers League in protest.</p>
        <p>Season 9 introduced milestone leveling and magic item limits. With milestone leveling, characters could gain a level whenever they finished an adventure. Characters had a maximum number of magic itmes that they could have, based on their level. Gold earned was based on hours of the adventure, but was "found" during the adventure, which was more organic than earning gold when leveling. The maximum amount of gold was still lower than had been awarded in previous seasons. Magic items that were found during the adventure could be claimed by anyone, subject to their maximum number. Many saw season 9 as an improvement over season 8, and some players who had left, returned.</p>
        <p>Season 10, the current season, introduced "seasonality" to AL. All prior seasons were relegated to a seperate "campaign" and limits were placed on what type of characters could play in the current adventures. Existing characters could not play in the new content, and players had to create new characters under the current rules. Season 10 characters were also prohibited from playing any of the older content and then returning to seasonal play. They also did away with the Con Created Content (CCC) program and replaced it with the DungeonCraft program. This will be discussed further later.</p>
        
        <h2>Four Current Campaigns</h2>
        <p>There are currently four campaigns in Adventurers League: the Historic, Seasonal (Season 10), and Masters Campaigns, which all take place in the Forgotten Realms setting, and the Eberron Campaign, which takes place in the Eberron setting.</p>
        <h3>Historic Campaign</h3>
        <p>The Historic Campaign consists of all content released in Seasons 1 through 9, including both previous hardback adventures and all CCC content. All characters who existed prior to Season 10 coming out are in the Historic Campaign. Characters in the Historic Campaign may play adventures in the Seasonal or Masters Campaign, but may not earn any rewards, including levels. A character in the Historic Campaign may leave the Historic Campaign for the Masters Campaign, but may not then return to the Historic Campaign. There is every indication that there will be <b>zero</b> new content published in the Historic Campaign.</p>
        <h3>Seasonal Campaign</h3>
        <p>The Seasonal Campaign is the campaign for Season 10 of AL, consisting of the hard cover adventure <em>Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</em>, AL Season 10 adventures, and DungeonCraft Plague of Ancients adventures. Some content, particularly races not common to the area, is excluded from character creation. New 1st level characters must be created for the campaign, utilizing the current rules. Characters may leave the Seasonal Campaign after 5th level for the Historic or Masters Campaign, but may not then return to the Seasonal Campaign. Characters in the Historic or Masters Campaign may play in Seasonal Campaign content, but may not earn rewards, including levels.</p>
        <h3>Masters Campaign</h3>
        <p>The Masters Campaign is another new development, introduced at the same time as the Seasonal Campaign, although some of the adventures that have been included in the Masters Campaign were published prior to its creation. The Masters Campaign, so far, includes a small number of adventures, with more to be added. The campaign currently includeds the "Dreams of the Red Wizards" (DRW) series of adventures. WotC has also partnered with third-party participants in AL, notably Baldman Games and GameHoleCon, who have been given their own areas of the Forgotten Realms in which to create adventures. The adventures these organizations have already created are part of the Historic Campaign, but their new adventures will be part of the Masters Campaign. The upcoming hardback, <em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em> will also be a part of the Masters Campaign. Basically, any new content that does not fit into the Seasonal Campaign will be in the Masters Campaign, as there will be no further content published for the Historic Campaign.</p>
        <h3>Eberron Campaign</h3>
        <p>The Eberron Campaign is an outlier. It is not set in the Forgotten Realms, but in the world of Eberron. It uses rules unique to its setting, and does not overlap with any of the other campaigns in any way. Only Eberron characters can play in the Eberron Campaign, and Eberron characters cannot play in any other campaign. The only adventures in the Eberron Campaign are the current series of Oracle of War adventures, as well as user-generated Salvage Missions. There were a previous series of adventures called Embers of the Last War, but these can no longer be played as part of the campaign, and characters that played in that series cannot be played in the current content.</p>
        
        <h2>Current Controversies</h2>
        <p>The main controversy with seasonality is what happens to existing characters. Since the new seasonal content cannot be played by existing characters (or at least they cannot earn rewards, which amounts to the same thing for many players), are those characters simply abandoned? Many players are attached to their characters, and have invested significant time and resources into them. Historic characters can join the Masters Campaign, but as of this writing, there is simply not enough Masters Campaign content. For example, there are Masters Campaign adventures in tiers 2, 3 and 4, but there is not enough content to get a 5th level character (Tier 2) to 11th level (Tier 3), nor enough content to get a character from 11th to 17th (Tier 4). The DRW adventures of the Masters Campaign comprise one over-arching story. There is currently no way for one character to play all of the DRW storyline without playing other adventures between them, which is now not allowed. The new hardback, <em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em>, will be released soon (March 16, 2021) and will provide a number of stand-alone adventures in the Masters Campaign to fill in these gaps.</p>
        <p>The Con Created Content (CCC) program allowed convention organizers to have content written for their convention that was AL legal and would premier at their convention, providing a draw to their convention. The adventure(s) would then be reviewed by the AL Admins before being published on DM's Guild, a website where pdf adventures could be purchased. This was labor-intensive for the Admins, and as a result, there was a large backlog of adventures awaiting approval. With Season 9, they introduced a number of adventure "seeds," general plots and guidance, such as allowed magic itmes, that all new CCC adventures, apart from a small number of approved adventures. The adventures from these seeds did not have to be approved prior to publishing on DM's Guild, freeing Admins from this duty. However, many people thought that these seeds were too limiting to prospective authors, especially with the small number of seeds. With Season 10, the CCC program was done away with entirely, being replaced with the DungeonCraft program. This program was made up enirely of such seeds, although there were many more of them. They could still be published without review and approval. The adventures for GameHoldCon and Baldman Games are not part of this program, being part of the Masters Campaign. One major issue many people have with the adventure seeds is that the number of seeds limits the magic items that can be awarded in the adventures. Many see this as the Admins preventing authors from awarding magic itmes that were too powerful.</p>
        <p>The final issue with seasonality is the complexity of having so many different campaigns. Where there used to be one campaign, with a few rules documents, there are now 3 campaigns in the Forgotten Realms, with 3 times as many rules. Record-keeping is now also 3 times as difficult for the players.</p>
        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Nobody is required to play under Adventurers League banner, and every adventure published for AL can be played outside of it. Some pplayers have taken this route. Unfortunately, there are also many players who are playing in AL, but choosing to ignore the rules they don't like. Regardless of any frustrations or issues players may have with the current rules, this is all a game we love, and AL or not, we will continue to play D&ampD.</p>
